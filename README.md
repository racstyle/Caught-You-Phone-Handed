# Staying in touch with your loved ones is important, but don't you think you should stay in touch with the road in front of you more?

Let's face it. We have places to go, sights to see, and people to meet! We also want to let those people know that we are safe and are on our way to meet them!

Wait, "safe"? How safe are we talking about? Safe as in "letting them know by texting on our phones as we drive 75 miles per hour on the highway" safe?

Umm, I do not think so.

Why? Let us see what a couple of reports say about what happens when you text and drive (especially at high speeds).

> * According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year on average. [1]
> * In a recent study, at least 36% of all crashes would have been avoided if there was not any distraction while driving. [2]

# What is this project?
This project is called Caught You Phone-Handed!  As the name suggests, our project aims to detect drivers on their phones while driving in order to enforce safe driving.

The basic idea is this device is to use object detection camera device which will catch people using their hand-held phones while driving.  The camera will take the picture of the person on their phone and their number plate if they are caught using their phone while driving. (The camera will not take any picture for the stationary cars)

# Credits
Team Asianeering would like to thank our Professor Ahmet Enis Cetin for being our project mentor and for helping us make this project become reality!

We would also like to thank professors Renata Revelo and Matthew Alonso for helping us (and other teams) prepare for this Spring 2021 Expo event.

The team also says a big thank you to the following people who made the software we used open-sourced:
* Darren for labelImg that allowed us to annotate/label our images to help train our detection model (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
* Due to GitHub's limitations to pushing large files to a forked repo, a new repo had to be made.  So this project was "forked" from his repo (https://github.com/nicknochnack/RealTimeObjectDetection).  We thank Nicholas profoundly for providing the code and tutorials that helped us make this project possible!
